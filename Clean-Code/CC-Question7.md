# Question 7 - Clean Code

## What is the role of comments in writing clean code in C#?

Comments play an important role in writing clean code in C#. They serve several purposes, including:

Documenting the code: Comments can provide information about the purpose, use, and behavior of the code, making it easier for others (including future you) to understand what the code is doing.

Improving readability: By adding comments to the code, developers can break down complex logic into smaller, more understandable parts, making it easier to follow the flow of the code.

Communicating with other developers: Comments can be used to communicate information about the code to other members of a development team, including notes on how the code works, limitations, or areas that may need improvement in the future.

Facilitating debugging: By adding comments to the code, developers can add context that can help to identify problems more easily when debugging.

It's important to keep in mind that comments should not be used to document bad code. Clean code is self-explanatory, so the best comments are the ones that aren't necessary. Instead, focus on writing clear, concise, and expressive code that does not require extensive comments to understand.
