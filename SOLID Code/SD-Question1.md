# Question 1 - SOLID Code

## Can you explain the Single Responsibility Principle in your own words, and how it applies to C# code?

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a software design principle that states that a class should have only one responsibility or reason to change. In other words, a class should be designed to do only one thing and do it well.

The SRP helps to improve the maintainability and testability of software by making it easier to understand and modify. When a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes more complex and harder to understand, making it more difficult to modify and test.

In C# code, the SRP can be applied by creating classes that have a single responsibility and by separating concerns into separate classes. For example, if a class is responsible for both validating user input and processing that input, it would be better to split those responsibilities into separate classes, each with its own single responsibility.

By adhering to the SRP, C# code can be designed to be more modular and easier to maintain, with fewer bugs and greater flexibility. It can also make code easier to reuse and extend, as each class can be designed to do one thing well, without needing to understand and modify a complex, multi-purpose class.
