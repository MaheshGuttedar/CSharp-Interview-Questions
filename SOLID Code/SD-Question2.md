# Question 2 - SOLID

## How would you refactor C# code that is tightly coupled between multiple classes?

Refactoring tightly coupled C# code can be a challenging task, but there are several techniques and patterns that you can use to achieve this goal. Here are a few steps that you can take to refactor C# code that is tightly coupled between multiple classes:

Identify the dependencies: The first step is to identify the dependencies between the classes. This involves examining the code and identifying which classes depend on each other, and how they interact with each other.

Reduce dependencies: Once you have identified the dependencies, you can start reducing them. One way to do this is by introducing interfaces and abstract classes. By using interfaces and abstract classes, you can define a contract between classes, which makes it easier to swap out one implementation for another without affecting the rest of the code.

Use Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection (DI) is a pattern that allows you to decouple the creation of objects from their use. Instead of creating an object directly in a class, you can inject the object as a dependency. This makes it easier to replace the implementation of a dependency, without affecting the rest of the code.

Use Design Patterns: Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. There are several design patterns that can help you reduce coupling in your code, such as the Observer pattern, the Adapter pattern, and the Command pattern.

Use SOLID Principles: The SOLID principles are a set of principles for object-oriented software design. They provide guidelines for creating software that is easy to maintain, extend, and test. By following these principles, you can create code that is more flexible and less tightly coupled.

Write Tests: Finally, it is essential to write tests for your code. Writing tests ensures that your code works as expected, and it allows you to make changes to your code with confidence. When refactoring tightly coupled code, tests can help you ensure that you have not introduced any regressions in your code.

In summary, refactoring tightly coupled C# code requires a combination of techniques such as identifying dependencies, reducing dependencies, using dependency injection, design patterns, SOLID principles, and writing tests. By using these techniques, you can create code that is easier to maintain, extend, and test.
