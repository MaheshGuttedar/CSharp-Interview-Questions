# SOLID Code - Introduction

SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that were introduced by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s. These principles are widely used in software engineering and are considered a standard practice for developing high-quality and maintainable code. In this article, we will discuss each of these principles and their significance in C# programming.

## SOLID Principles

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
This principle states that every class should have only one responsibility, i.e., one reason to change. A class should be focused on doing one thing and doing it well. If a class has multiple responsibilities, then it becomes difficult to maintain and test. Separating responsibilities allows for easier maintenance and modification of code.

Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
This principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a class without modifying its existing code. This can be achieved by using interfaces and abstract classes. By using these abstractions, we can extend the behavior of the class without modifying its existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
This principle states that a subclass should be able to substitute its parent class without any unexpected behavior. This means that a subclass should not change the behavior of its parent class. The LSP is closely related to the OCP because it allows for easy extension of classes without breaking existing code.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
This principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces that it does not use. Instead, it should be separated into smaller and more specific interfaces. By doing this, we can ensure that a class is only implementing the interfaces that it needs. This can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
This principle states that a high-level module should not depend on a low-level module. Instead, they should both depend on abstractions. This means that we should use interfaces and abstract classes to define the dependencies of a class. By doing this, we can reduce coupling between classes and make the code more maintainable.

## Why Mastering SOLID Principles is Important for Technical Interviews?

SOLID principles are essential for technical interviews because they demonstrate a strong understanding of software engineering principles. Employers are looking for candidates who can write high-quality, maintainable, and scalable code. By demonstrating a good understanding of SOLID principles, you can show that you are capable of writing code that meets these requirements.

Moreover, mastering SOLID principles can also help you become a better software developer. These principles provide a set of guidelines for writing code that is easy to maintain, modify, and scale. By following these principles, you can reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs and increase the overall quality of your code.
