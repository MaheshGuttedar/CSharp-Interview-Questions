# Question 5 - SOLID

## How do you identify duplicated code in C#, and what techniques can be used to remove it?

Identifying duplicated code in C# can be a manual or automated process.

Manual process involves reading through the codebase, looking for identical or near-identical code segments. This can be a time-consuming process, but it can provide a good understanding of the codebase and identify subtle variations that an automated tool might miss.

Automated process involves using specialized tools like ReSharper, Visual Studio, and other third-party tools to automatically identify and highlight duplicated code segments. These tools use various algorithms to detect similarities and suggest changes to remove duplication.

Once duplicated code has been identified, there are several techniques to remove it:

Extract the duplicated code into a shared method or function: If you find a section of code that is used in multiple places in your application, you can extract it into a shared method or function that can be called from each location.

Use inheritance: If you have classes with duplicated code, you can use inheritance to create a base class with the shared code, and then have the duplicated classes inherit from the base class.

Use interfaces: You can create an interface that defines the shared behavior and implement it in each class that needs it, removing the need for duplicated code.

Use polymorphism: You can use polymorphism to create a single method that can handle different types of objects, instead of creating multiple methods that handle each type separately.

Use a code generation tool: There are several code generation tools available that can help automate the process of removing duplicated code. These tools can create shared methods or classes based on a set of rules, reducing the need for manual intervention.

Overall, identifying and removing duplicated code can improve code quality, reduce maintenance costs, and make your application more scalable and easier to maintain in the long run.
