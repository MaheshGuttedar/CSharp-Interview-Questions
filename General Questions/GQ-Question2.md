# Question 2 - General Questions

## What is object-oriented programming?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to model and interact with the world around us. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of the object.

In OOP, objects have state (data) and behavior (methods). State refers to the data that an object contains, while behavior refers to the actions or operations that the object can perform.

One of the main principles of OOP is encapsulation, which means that objects hide their internal data and provide a public interface for other objects to interact with. This helps to reduce complexity and increase modularity in software systems.

In addition to encapsulation, OOP also includes concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, while polymorphism allows objects to take on multiple forms or types depending on the context in which they are used.

Overall, OOP is a powerful and widely-used programming paradigm that allows developers to write complex and maintainable software by organizing it into objects with well-defined properties and behaviors.
