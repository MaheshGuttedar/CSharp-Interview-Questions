# Question 6 - General Questions

## What is an interface in C# and what is its purpose?

In C#, an interface is a programming construct that defines a contract between two parts of a program: the interface and the implementing class. An interface defines a set of methods, properties, and events that the implementing class must implement, but it does not provide any implementation itself.

The purpose of an interface is to provide a way for classes to communicate with each other without needing to know about the specific implementation of the other class. By using interfaces, you can define a set of methods and properties that a class must implement in order to satisfy the contract of the interface. This makes it easier to write code that can work with a variety of different classes that share a common set of behaviors.

Interfaces are often used in object-oriented programming to achieve polymorphism, which is the ability of objects of different types to be treated as if they are of the same type. By defining a common interface, you can write code that can work with any class that implements that interface, without needing to know the specific implementation details of the class. This can make your code more modular, easier to maintain, and more flexible.
